I'm a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), supervised by [Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) and advised by [Richard Turner](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/ret26). My research interests are motivated by the need for the effective and efficient deployment of probabilistic machine learning techniques to improve decision making and prediction in the presence of uncertainty.

Before my PhD, I completed an M.Phil. in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), during which I worked with [Richard Turner](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/ret26) on the development of approximate inference techniques in deep Gaussian process latent variable models. Prior to that, I completed an M.Eng. in [Information and Computer Engineering](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/academic-divisions/information-engineering) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), where I worked with [Elena Punskaya](https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/person/dr-elena-punskaya) on the automatic detection of atrial fibrillation.
