I'm a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), supervised by [Dr. Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) and supervised by [Professor Richard E. Turner](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/ret26). My research interest spans the field of probabilistic machine learning, with a particular interest in developing effective and efficient approximate inference methods. 

Before my PhD, I completed an M.Phil. in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk) and M.Eng. in [Information and Computer Engineering](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/academic-divisions/information-engineering), both at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk).
